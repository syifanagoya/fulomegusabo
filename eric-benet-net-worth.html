Sources state that Benet has acquired a net worth of over $5 million, as of mid-2016. His wealth has been earned during his music career, and through his involvement in the film and television industry as well, during a career spanning over 20 years.</p><h3>Eric Benét Net Woprth $5 Million</h3><p>Benet was raised in Milwaukee, along with his five older siblings, all of who were musically talented. During the late ’80s he sang with a Top 100-style group called Gerard. In the early ’90s, along with his sister Lisa and cousin George Nash, Jr., he formed a band called Benet and released an album of the same name, which sold over 100,000 copies.</p><p>Becoming a solo artist in 1994, Benet signed with Warner Bros. Records and two years later released his debut solo album called “True To Myself”, with singles “Spiritual Thang”, “Femininity” and “Let’s Stay Together” reaching high popularity and domination of the charts. The singer came into the national spotlight when he released his second album “A Day in the Life” in 1999, an album that won a Soul Train Music Award for “Best R&B/Soul Album, Male”, with the song “Spend My Life With You” becoming an instant hit. The gold certified single reached #1 on the US Billboard R&B charts and was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for “Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group”. Benet’s popularity boosted and his net worth started to rise.</p><p>As Warner Bros. refused to release his next album, the 2001 “Better And Better”, forcing the singer to stay inside the R&B genre, Benet signed with Friday Records and released a new album called “Hurricane” in 2005, with the single “I Wanna Be Loved” reaching #2 on the Urban Adult Contemporary chart. In 2008 he released his fourth album called “Love & Life”, which reached #11 on the Billboard 200 and #2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album brought him two Grammy nominations, for Best R&B Album and for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for the single “You’re the Only One”, which became a huge hit worldwide. Benet released his fifth album “Lost In Time” in 2010, with the song “Sometimes I Cry” reaching #1 on the Hot Adult R&B Songs Chart and earning a Grammy nomination for “Best Traditional R&B Performance”.</p><p>Not long after, in partnership with EMI Records Benet formed a record label called Jordan House Records, and released his sixth album, “The One” in 2012, containing the hits “Runnin”, “Real Love” and “Harriett Jones”; the album earned him the Soul Tracks Readers’ Choice Award for Best Male Vocalist. The year 2014 saw the release of Benet’s international album called “The Other One”, and the same year his album “From E to U, Vol. 1”. came out, exclusively distributed in Japan. All added to his wealth. Benet’s next album has been announced to be released in fall 2016.</p><p>Aside from his music career, Benet has also been involved in the film and television industry. He had a recurring role in the late ’90s television series “For Your Love”. He made his film debut in the 2001 <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> showbiz drama movie “Glitter”, then in 2005 Benet appeared in the sitcom “Half & Half”, and was later cast as a music producer in the MTV television show “Kaya” in 2007. His second film role was in the 2011 “Trinity Goodheart”, and 2013 saw him in the hit TV reality show “The Real Husbands of Hollywood”. Benet’s acting career has greatly contributed to his popularity and to his net worth as well.</p><p>When speaking about his private life, during the ’90s Benet had a relationship with Tami Marie Stauff, with whom he has one child. Stauff tragically died in a car accident in 1993. In 2001 he married actress <a href=#>Halle Berry</a>, however, the couple divorced in 2005. Since 2011 he has been married to Manuela Testolini, Prince’s ex-wife, and has two children with her.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.218330849478><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 15, 1966</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 11" (1.8 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>American R&B, neo soul singer-songwriter, Actor, Record producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Manuela Testolini (m. 2011), Halle Berry (m. 2001–2005)</td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/ericbenetmusic</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42424242424242><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/ebenet</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/ericbenet</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38888888888889><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/ericbenet</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2545174</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28571428571429><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/eric-benét-mn0000800475</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>Soul Train Music Award for "Best R&B/Soul Album, Male (1999), Black Reel Awards - Best Original or Adapted Song (2002), NAACP Image Award - Outstanding Song (2000)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Record Labels</td><td>Warner Bros., Friday/Reprise, Jordan House/EMI, Jordan House/Primary Wave Music</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Albums</td><td>True to Myself (1996), A Day in the Life (1999), Better and Better (2001), Hurricane (2005), Love & Life (2008), Lost in Time (2010), The One (2012), Eric Benét (2016), The Other One (2014), From E to U: Volume 1 (2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>"Gerard", "Benet"</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Awards, NAACP Image Awards, BET Centric Awards (2011, 2006), Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Male Artist/Album of the Year (2000, 2011, 2012)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Movies</td><td>"Trinity Goodheart"(2011), "For Your Love", "Glitter" (2001), "Half & Half" (2005), , "The Real Husbands of Hollywood" (2013), "Kaya" (2007)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=25.436464088398><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4.7603305785124><td>1</td><td>Accompanied his then-wife, <a href=#>Halle Berry</a>, to the Academy Awards, on the night she won her Oscar for <a href=#>Monster's Ball</a> (2001).</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>2</td><td>Father of a 3rd daughter named Amoura Luna, born July 13, 2014, with his second wife, Manuela Testolini.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>Father of a 2nd daughter named Lucia Bella, born December 21, 2011, with his second wife, Manuela Testolini.</td></tr><tr readability=8.8150684931507><td>4</td><td>Married <a href=#>Prince</a>'s ex-wife Manuela Testolini at The Resort at Pelican Hill (Newport Beach, California).
