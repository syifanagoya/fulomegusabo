<time>06 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Courtney Coco sister, Lace Shawntelle Evans, was devastated and heartbroken upon her sister’s untimely demise. The 19-year-old Courtney Coco was brutally murdered, and her body was discovered days later in an abysmal state.&nbsp;</p><p>Coco’s body was discovered in an abandoned Winnie, Texas, building on October 4th, 2004. The body had severely decayed and was almost beyond the stage of recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>Courtney and Lace’s <a href=#>relationship</a> was not like an ordinary sibling relationship. The two sisters were related to each other in a way that no one could have imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Lace’s fiance, David Anthony Burns, was also the deceased 19-year-old’s secret boyfriend. While David knowingly two-timed with Courtney and Lace, the recipients of this deception had no clue about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Burns’ link with the two sisters was not only romantic. Sixteen years after Courtney’s unthinkable death, authorities discovered that he was the one who abducted and subsequently killed Courtney.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities arrested David Anthony Burns after witnesses came forward and alleged that David had admitted to committing Courtney’s murder when it was being investigated.&nbsp;</p><p>The police “allegedly” forgot to mention David’s admission of guilt during the initial stages of the investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>A careless mistake on the police’s end allowed a murderer to roam on the streets freely for sixteen years.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2021, David Anthony Burns was arrested and indicted in relation to Courtney Coco’s murder.&nbsp;</p><p>In October 2022, after being found guilty, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Better late than never, right?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Courtney Coco NBC Dateline</h2><p>Almost 19 years after Coco’s shocking death, the world will get a chance to look at her gruesome death closely.&nbsp;</p><p>NBC’s famous program ‘Dateline’ will exclusively feature Courtney Coco’s abduction, death, the discovery of her decayed body, and the arrest of her perpetrator.&nbsp;</p><p>The two-hour-long episode, titled ‘Who Killed Courtney Coco,’&nbsp; aired on Friday, April 14th, on NBC.&nbsp;</p><p>The episode will focus on the conviction of David Anthony Burns 16 years after he committed the most horrific crime of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>The show will serve as a reminder of how one’s criminal past catches up with them one day or the other.&nbsp;</p><p>Courtney Coco sister and her family finally got the justice they had been waiting for after David’s arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>The exclusive feature will only be one episode long. No news of the Courtney Coco case being turned into a series is circulating on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The response to the episode will play a huge role in determining whether the creators of this program would like to turn Coco’s case into a series.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who killed Courtney Coco?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Who-killed-Courtney-Coco.jpg><p>Courtney Coco, a 19-years-old student at Northwestern State University, was murdered by her sister’s then-fiance as well as her secret boyfriend, David Anthony Burns.&nbsp;</p><p>The primary investigation could not yield her cause of death. Years later, the authorities discovered her killer had smothered her to death with a pillow.&nbsp;</p><p>David was charged with second-degree murder with no benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.</p><p>He was consistent in declaring his innocence and kept proclaiming that he did not do what he was being accused of.</p><p>David went as far as saying that Courtney Coco sister and the rest of her family would not find peace because they were framing him and destroying his life.&nbsp;</p><p>The convicted murderer repeatedly said he was not hiding anything as he had nothing to hide.</p><p>People who spoke at the hearing recalled the time of Coco’s funeral. They mentioned how David helped the victim’s grandfather when he had a stroke at her funeral.</p><p>He was also one of the pallbearers at Coco’s funeral. Courtney Coco sister and family, even in their wildest dreams, wouldn’t have imagined him to be their beloved’s killer.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Courtney Coco parents’ reaction to David’s indictment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Coco-Family.jpg><p>David, who was once profoundly loved by Stephanie Belgard, Coco and Lace’s mother, received a lot of hate and backlash from her in the courtroom.&nbsp;</p><p>Stephanie exhibited a lot of rage and anger towards him and openly said, ‘I hope you rot in hell.’</p><p>She further exclaimed that she never wanted to see his face ever again and that nothing could fix the mistake he had made.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Stephanie was struggling to keep her emotions in control. She pointed towards a photo of her deceased daughter and read aloud a poem that Coco wrote about what she wanted to do with her life.&nbsp;</p><p>On a personal aspect, Coco dreamt of being a mother to two daughters and one son. On the professional end, she hoped to become a pediatrician or a teacher because helping people was her thing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“You denied her that. You denied her that chance,” </strong>Stephanie stated while looking at David with eyes full of rage, sadness, and tears.&nbsp;</p><p>Since her daughter’s death, Stephanie Belgard has become the face and the force for families of violent crime.&nbsp;</p><p>She works with the national group Parents of Murdered Children. The group offers support and help to the victim’s families in whatever way possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Individually and as part of the group, she supports other families as their loved ones’ cases go through emotionally draining trials.&nbsp;</p><p>Stephanie stated how important Coco was to each of her family members and what David took from them all by murdering her.&nbsp;</p><p>David’s indictment and sentencing hurt Courtney Coco sister, mother, and other family members because he was hiding under their noses while they were relentlessly looking for her criminal.&nbsp;</p><p>Stephanie criticized David’s decision to become a youth pastor. She said it was a way for him to hide his criminal past from the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after all these years, Coco’s mom Stephanie did not come to terms with her daughter’s brutal death.&nbsp;</p><p>The last sentence of her statement, ‘I want my baby girl back,’ clearly showed how David’s crime had taken away a precious part of her life.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvzq6praaVrnqku8KoZKyho6mys3s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcourtney-coco-sister.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcourtney-coco-sister.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcourtney-coco-sister.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcourtney-coco-sister.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcourtney-coco-sister.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcourtney-coco-sister.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./richest-celebrities.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./richest-celebrities.html>Kevin Max Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shyam-pathak.html>Shyam Pathak Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shyam-pathak.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
