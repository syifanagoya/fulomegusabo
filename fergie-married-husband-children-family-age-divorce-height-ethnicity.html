<time>24 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Fergie is a singer who was the only woman in the popular hip hop/rock group called the Black Eyed Peas, who also managed to end a solo career when she finally decided to give it a try.&nbsp;She has found success as an artist with her unique and beautiful voice and although she has been largely absent from music lately she is still widely admired.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Fergie’s Bio (Ethnicity)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Fergie’s full name at birth was given as StacyAnn Ferguson and they were born on March 27, 1975 at a location in California known as Hacienda Heights.&nbsp;She is of truly mixed ethnicity with English, Native American, Irish and Scottish roots.&nbsp;She attended Mesa Robles Middle School and then Glen A. Wilson High School.&nbsp;She excelled at school and was a master spell checker.</span></p><p><span>She began her career in entertainment as an actress.&nbsp;She did a few commercials and then landed a role in&nbsp;</span><span>Kids Incorporated</span><span>&nbsp;in 1984. The show helped showcase her musical talent as it featured members of a fictional musical group called Kids Incorporated.&nbsp;The show was acquired by Disney Channel after initial syndication and Fergie stayed on the show for six seasons.</span></p><p><span>Fergie would form a pop group known as&nbsp;</span><span>Wild Orchid</span><span>&nbsp;with several other former members of the KidsIncorporated Cast in the 1990s.&nbsp;They released their first project in 1996 and had some modest hits, but their next project didn’t do so well.&nbsp;At this point, Fergie fell into a wild lifestyle and was soon addicted to crystal methamphetamine.&nbsp;She soon decided to give up the lifestyle and quit her drug habit in 2002.</span></p><p><span>While still getting her life back, she became part of the Black Eyed Peas, which was becoming a popular hip-hop group at the time.&nbsp;She seemed to have been the missing piece as their first project together titled&nbsp;</span><span>Elephunk</span><span>&nbsp;became a hit in 2003.&nbsp;It resulted in several successful singles like&nbsp;</span><span>Where is love</span><span>&nbsp;?&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>hey mom</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In fact, they won a Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for&nbsp;</span><span>Let</span><span>&nbsp;‘s Get Started .</span></p><span>In 2005 Black Eyed Peas released their next album called&nbsp;</span><span>Unfug</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;The album peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200.&nbsp;The group won another Grammy in 2005 for Best Rap Performance for&nbsp;</span><span>Phunk not with my heart</span><span>&nbsp;and another in 2006 for Best Pop Performance for&nbsp;</span><span>Meine Höcker</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In 2009, the group released another successful project,&nbsp;</span><span>Das Ende.&nbsp;</span><span>they had hit songs like&nbsp;</span><span>Boom Boom Pow</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>I got a feeling</span><span>&nbsp;about it .</span><p><span>After the success with the Black Eyed Peas, Fergie made a solo album in 2006 entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Die Holländerin.&nbsp;</span><span>It was a successful project with hits such as&nbsp;</span><span>Big Girls Don’t Cry</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>London Bridge</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Glamorous</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;She released another solo project in 2017 titled&nbsp;</span><span>Doppelte Holländerin</span><span>&nbsp;around the same time her collaboration with the Black Eyed Peas ended.&nbsp;She led a rendition of&nbsp;</span><span>The Stars</span><span>&nbsp;and Stripes that set social media ablaze at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game.&nbsp;The heat was so great that she later had to admit that the rendition didn’t take on the intended tone.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – husband, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Fergie married actor Josh Duhamel in January 2009.&nbsp;They met when the Black Eyed Peas made a cameo for a TV show he was titled&nbsp;</span><span>Las Vegas</span><span>&nbsp;on and they started dating before getting engaged in December 2007.&nbsp;They have one child together, a son named Axl Jack who was born in August 2013.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Married Life and&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Divorce</span></strong></h2><p><span>Fergie and ex-husband Josh Duhamel announced their split in September 2017 after eight years of marriage.&nbsp;Their divorce seemed amicable as they even issued a statement saying they would remain united in their support for each other and the family they had started together.</span></p><h2><strong><span>how tall is fergie</span></strong></h2><p><span>Fergie stands at a height of 157 cmand weighs 57 kg.&nbsp;She has a flexible training program as she does not depend on a personal trainer.&nbsp;She alternates exercise regimes between options like weight training, walking, and elliptical trainers that use bands.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may
