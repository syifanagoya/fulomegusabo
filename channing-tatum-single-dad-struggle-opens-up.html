As he explained to the <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Today</a></strong> hosts, writing this series of books has greatly helped the actor with his journey as a father.

Speaking to <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a></strong> earlier in a June 2 interview about this moment from their past, Channing explained: "It was eating her up that she took it.
