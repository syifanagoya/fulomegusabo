I’m assuming it’s 10/2 with ground? It is OK to use a wire that is somewhat bigger than necessary for safety reasons. Mechanically, a #10 should fit in the breaker just fine (check the breaker’s specifications), however it may not fit in the GFCI.
As a result, is it permissible to utilise 10 gauge wire for outlets? Wire Gauge for 240-Volt Electrical Outlets Because of voltage drop, 10-gauge wire is the minimum wire size for a 30-amp 240-volt circuit, but you should consider upgrading to 8-gauge if the outlet is located far enough from the panel to avoid poor performance as a result of voltage drop.</p><footer><a href=../../can-you-use-10-2-wire-outlet-html.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../david-le-batard-illness-and-cause-of-death.html>David Le Batard Illness And Cause Of Death</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
