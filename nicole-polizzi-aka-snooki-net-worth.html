She had purchased the home in November 2015 for $370,000. Seeing that the property was sold for double the price that it was bought for, Snooki definitely benefitted from the sales.</p><p>Apart from real estate investments, the popular television personality has owned cars like the 2011 Cadillac Escalade, which she sold for $77,510 on eBay in February 2013. She might also have other different vehicles for which she must have arranged a good insurance policy.</p><p>Thus, Snooki lives a great life with her family.
