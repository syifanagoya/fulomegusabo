Born on June 1, 1973 in West Germany, she is Gunther and Erna Klum. Her mother was a hairdresser and her father was an executive for a major cosmetics company. When she was only 19, she allowed a friend to talk her into joining a contest with 25,000 other young women to become the next famous model, and she actually won in 1992. She was offered a $300,000 modeling contract with Metropolitan Models and moved to New York City to work. She accepted the contract when she finished high school and decided to forgo college.</p><p>She moved to New York City and began her modeling career. Unlike some models, Heidi Klum did not find it difficult to book jobs. She’s stunning, yet she has the personality and appearance of a woman who just wants to be your friend and light up your life. She was doing well in the business before she began booking Sports Illustrated shoots, and she became even more famous when she became a cover girl. However, it wasn’t until she became one of the very famous Victoria’s Secret Angel’s that she became a household name and everyone learned who she was.</p><p>Her career has been one of the most impressive in the history of supermodels, making her one of the most famous in the world. Heidi Klum has been a model for Victoria’s Secret, Jordache Jeans, Braun, H & M, McDonalds, Liz Claiborne, VW, and many other brands. She’s also appeared in a number of movies including The Devil Wears Prada, Ella Enchanted and the Life and Death of Peter Sellers. She’s also been a guest star in some very famous television shows, such as How I Met Your Mother, Sex and the City, Yes, Dear and Spin City.</p><p>Heidi Klum is not just a model, however. She is also a television host and a producer, and she is famous for creating and producing Project Runway, a reality show that takes wanna-be designers and allows them to compete to win a fashion line and a name for themselves. She has been the host of the show since the beginning, even managing to do that and balance her life as a mother to four small children. Most of her income comes from her many modeling jobs, her show and her endorsements.</p><p>Heidi Klum is a mother with four kids, three with her ex-husband, Seal, and one she was pregnant with when she and Seal began their relationship. Seal was her second husband, as she married a stylist by the name of Ric Pipino in 1997. They married for five years, divorced in 2002 and she began a relationship with Flavio Briatore, the manager of the Renault Formula One Team. He is the father of her oldest child, but he is not involved in her life and Seal in her father by all means. The couple went on to begin dating when she was pregnant, married a year after their daughter was born and had three more children before announcing their divorce in 2012.</p><p>Photo Credit – Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGifnqGUnnqsuNSmZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheidi-klum-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheidi-klum-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheidi-klum-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheidi-klum-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheidi-klum-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheidi-klum-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bruce-willis-wife-emma-daughter-mabel-rare-photos-birthday-tribute.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bruce-willis-wife-emma-daughter-mabel-rare-photos-birthday-tribute.html>Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming shares rare videos of daughter Mabel in honor of 12th birthday: 'Keep</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./calum-hood-girlfriend.html>Calum Hood Girlfriend: Who is The Actor Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./calum-hood-girlfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
