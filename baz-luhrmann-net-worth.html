Baz Luhrmann began to make a name for himself directing theater productions in Australia, then he shifted his focus to film, with his first project being the 1992 film version of his play "Strictly Ballroom." A surprise hit, the film earned Baz several awards and put him on the map as a director to watch. Since then, he has written, directed, and produced the films "Romeo + Juliet" (1996), "Moulin Rouge!" (2001), "Australia" (2008), and "The Great Gatsby" (2013).</p><p>Of the 10 highest-grossing Australian films of all time, four were directed by Luhrmann. He also created the 2016 Netflix series "The Get Down," and as an actor, he had an uncredited role in "The Great Gatsby" and has appeared in the films "Winter of Our Dreams" (1981) and "The Dark Room" (1982), the TV movie "The Highest Honor" (1982), and the television series "A Country Practice" (1981â€“1982). Baz directed a 2002 Broadway production of "La bohÃ¨me," which received seven Tony nominations, including Best Direction of a Musical and Best Revival of a Musical. "Moulin Rouge!" was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2019, and it earned Luhrmann a Tony for Best Musical. Though he did not direct "Moulin Rouge! The Musical!," Baz was credited with Creative Services in the playbill, and he produced the Broadway cast recording. Luhrmann launched the record label House of Iona, and he released the 1998 album "Something for Everybody," which included tracks from his films as well as the hit song "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Baz Luhrmann was born Mark Anthony Luhrmann on September 17, 1962, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Baz appeared in a St Paul's Catholic College production of William Shakespeare's "Henry IV," and he met Craig Pearce (who would later co-write "Strictly Ballroom," "Romeo + Juliet," "Moulin Rouge!," and "The Great Gatsby" with him) at Narrabeen Sports High School.

The couple put the six-bedroom, five-bathroom property on the market for a shade under $20 million in March 2022, with Catherine stating, "We just thought, 'This is ridiculous.' The house has been empty for almost three years. And someone should take advantage of it. But it breaks our hearts."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7w6KpnpukpL%2B0e8GasWakpZ2%2Frq3Np2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./logan-grove.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./logan-grove.html>Logan Grove: TV Actor, Voice Actor, Movies &amp;amp; TV Shows, Dream, Twitter, Minecraft, Now, Age, Net Wort</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nicole-polizzi-aka-snooki-net-worth.html>Nicole Polizzi aka Snooki Net Worth Earned Five Figure Salary Per Episodes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nicole-polizzi-aka-snooki-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
