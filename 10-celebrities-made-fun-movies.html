But I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn’t lying to myself–that’s why I did it.”</p><p>(Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/458669612.jpg alt="Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences' 2014 Governors Awards - Arrivals" width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>9. Mark Wahlberg</strong></p><p>Mark Wahlberg’s career hit a bit of a speed bump after the release of the 2008 film, The Happening. &nbsp;Although Walhberg’s performance received many positive reviews, the film was an overall flop. &nbsp;Critics gave the film negative reviews and questioned director M. Night Shyamalan’s film making skills. &nbsp;Wahlberg himself was critical of the film and joked about his role stating: “…you can’t blame me for not wanting to try to play a science teacher. At least I wasn’t playing a cop or a crook.”</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/186681453.jpg alt="LACMA 2013 Art + Film Gala - Arrivals" width=640 height=462 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>8.

After the release of his 2008 film, Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, LaBeouf made several tongue-in-cheek comments when he stated: “I think the audience is pretty intelligent. I think they know when you’ve made [a bad movie].”</p><p>(Photo by Tim P.

Megan Fox</strong></p><p>After appearing in the 2009 sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, actress Megan Fox expressed her frustrating with the film. &nbsp;Although the film was meant to be an enjoyable action film, Fox felt as though it was too difficult to understand. &nbsp;Fox told CBS: “I’m in the movie and I read the script and I watched the movie and I still didn’t know what was happening. I think if you haven’t read the script and you go and see it and understand it, you may be a genius. This is a movie for geniuses.”</p><p>(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/450138024.jpg alt='"The Rover" - Sydney Photo Call' width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;Robert Pattison</strong></p><p>Although most of the world seemed to love the Twighlight film series, one of its stars didn’t feel the same. &nbsp;Robert Pattinson, who played vampire Edward Cullen, was critical of the films’ storyline and poked fun at the series. &nbsp;During an interview with Entertainment Weekly Pattison joked: &nbsp;“I didn’t want to do a stupid teen movie. I specifically hadn’t done anything which anyone would see since&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter</i>&nbsp;because I wanted to teach myself how to act. I didn’t want to be an idiot. This came kind of randomly and I didn’t really know what it was when it first started. I was going to wait for another year. I wanted to do two or three more little things and then do something bigger. And then this kind of happened and I was like, ‘Well, okay…”</p><p>(Photo by Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187527788.jpg alt="2013 BAFTA LA Jaguar Britannia Awards Presented by BBC America - Show" width=640 height=483 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>3. George Clooney</strong></p><p>It’s no secret that George Clooney (and everyone else) has been very critical about his role as Batman in the 1997 film, Batman & Robin. &nbsp;However, thanks to his self-awareness and good sense of humor, Clooney has been able to move past the horrible film. &nbsp;Years after the film debuted, Clooney apologized for ruining the Batman franchise and stated: ““I think since Batman that I’ve been disinvited from Comic-Con for 20 years. I see the comment sections on all you guys. I just met Adam West there [referring to behind the NYCC main stage] and I apologized to him.&nbsp;Sorry about the nipples on the suit. Freeze, freeze, I apologize for that.”</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/489817201.jpg alt="2014 NBC Upfront Presentation" width=640 height=469 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Katherine Heigl</strong></p><p>Katherine Heigl has often been referred to as Hollywood’s most hated actress. &nbsp;However, even amidst all of the hate, Heigl has managed to remain objective about her films. Although the popular comedy film Knocked Up was a hit among fans, Heigl didn’t seem to find humor in the film’s portrayal of women. &nbsp;Heigl stated: “It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.</p><p>(Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/481516747.jpg alt='"Divergent" - European Premiere - Red Carpet Arrivals' width=640 height=484 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>1. Kate Winslet</strong></p><p>Kate Winslet is best known for her role in the award-winning film Titanic. &nbsp;In the years since its release, Titanic has become one of the most memorable and well-liked films of the 90s. &nbsp;However, Winslet has often been critical of the film, and has stated that she does not enjoy watching her performance. Winslet has said: “Every single scene, I’m like ‘Really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God.&nbsp;Even my American accent, I can’t listen to it. It’s awful.” Winslet has also revealed that even hearing the film’s famous theme song “My Heart Will Go On” has left her with &nbsp;“a massive internal eye roll.”</p><p>(Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2K6orDEZp2upl2ivLe1xKxm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebrities-made-fun-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebrities-made-fun-movies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebrities-made-fun-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebrities-made-fun-movies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebrities-made-fun-movies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-made-fun-movies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zoey-101s-alexa-nikolas-cries-amid-jamie-lynn-spears-drama.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zoey-101s-alexa-nikolas-cries-amid-jamie-lynn-spears-drama.html>Zoey 101's Alexa Nikolas Cries Amid Jamie Lynn Spears Drama</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tisch-raye-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Tisch Raye Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tisch-raye-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
